What it does, is it really builds a new dataframe. You can use this to reduce a large dataset, if you sort it to the rows you're interested at the top - you can use head and tail to snip off the most interesting first few or last few rows in the dataframe. *save the head to a new variable, and return it* you can run head on it again, it is a fully functional dataframe just like titles was.\n",
